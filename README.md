# My-Programming-projects
Hello, my name is Zion King, and I am a Computer Science student at North Carolina A&amp;T State University.  This is my programming portfolio, featuring projects from my classes and personal work. I'm always improving my coding skills and exploring new technologies. My goal is to become a video game developer and create immersive gaming experiences.
